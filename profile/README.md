# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are Planetside players who help the community build better tools for the game.

<br>

## Enabling a better ecosystem

Our mission is to provide the Planetside developer ecosystem with unique data and approaches to bring their tools to every player.

### UI mods
To fundamentally improve how the game is played, we are building a UI modding platform, which allows developers to integrate their tools right into the game's UI. Think fisu, ps2alerts or honu, as if it had always been part of the game itself. We accomplish this by detecting the game's UI state and allow devs to automatically draw their own Web UI over detected elements.
