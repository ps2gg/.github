# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are Planetside players who help the community build better tools for the game.

<br>

## Enabling a better ecosystem

Our mission is to provide the Planetside ecosystem with data you won't find on the Census API, and to help developers integrate their services seamlessly into the game via UI mods.

### What we're providing to the community:
- **A UI modding platform**<br> that lets you integrate your service as if it had always been part of the game
- **A player verification service**<br> to link ingame characters to your user system
- **Account-wide character detection**<br> to help you generate your data across all of a player's characters
- **Per-fight metrics**<br> that give context to every interaction in the game
  
And many, many smaller services you can find in the [official ps2.gg repo](https://github.com/ps2gg/ps2.gg).
