# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are developers from the Planetside community who help others build extraordinary services and get them right into the game via UI mods.

<br>

## Enabling a better ecosystem

Our mission is to provide the Planetside ecosystem with data you won't find on the Census API, and to help developers integrate their services seamlessly into the game via UI mods.

### Our existing services
- **A player verification service** to link ingame characters to your user system
- **Account-wide character detection** to help you generate your data across all of a player's characters

### What we work towards
- **Per-fight metrics** that give context to every interaction in the game
- **A UI modding platform** that lets you integrate your service as if it had always been part of the game
